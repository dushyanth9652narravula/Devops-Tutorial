# Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

- Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services such as computing power, storage and databases, on as needed basis from cloud providers like Amazon Web services, Google Cloud Provider and Azure.

- Organizations of every type, size and industry are using the cloud for wide variety of uses cases such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and custumer facing web applications. For example health care companies are using cloud for providing more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services are using cloud to power real time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using cloud to deliver online games to millions of players over the world.

- There are actually so many benifits with cloud computing. Those are :

  **Agility** : The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up the resources as you need them from infrastructure services such as computing power, storage, databases to the Internet of Things, Machine Learning, data lakes and analytics and much more.

  **Elasticity** : With Cloud computing, you doesn't need to over provision the resources you need upfront to handle the peak levels of business activity in future. Instead you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up and down to instantly grow and shrink the capacity as your business needs change. 

  **Cost Savings** : The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses and you pay only for IT that you consume. Plus, the variable expenses are very lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of economics of sale.

  **Deploying in Minitues** : With the cloud, you can expand to new geographical regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locaton with few clicks. Putting the applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.

- There are actually three types of cloud computing. Those are IAAS, PAAS, SAAS. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibilty, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs.

  **Infrastructure as Service (IAAS)** : IAAS contains the basic buliding blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides the access to networking features, computers (virtual or dedicated hardware) and data storage space. IAAS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. In IAAS, you actually gets all the resources such as computing power, OS and Storage space. You actually need to arrange them however you want based on your application. Examples in AWS are : EC2, S3, VPC etc.

  **Platform as Service (PAAS)** : PAAS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (such as computing power and storage) and focus on deployment and management of your application. This helps you be more efficient as you doesn't need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintainace, patching, or any other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. In PAAS, you doesn't need to worry about infrastructure such as servers and storages, just just need to upload your code to a particular service and that services takes care of required installations, manages server and scaling, handles load balancing and security patches, and finally connects your app to database. Examples in AWs are Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda etc.

  **Software as Service (SaaS)** : SaaS provides you a complete product that you just need to use and it is managed by the service provider. In most cases, people reffering SaaS are reffering to end-user applications (such as web based email). With SAAS offering you doesn't have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how to use the particular service.

## Introduction to AWS

- AWS stands for Amazon Web Services which is a cloud provider and provides cloud services all over the world. They provides servers and some technology services that you can use on demand and scale them easily.
- AWS has revolutionized IT over the time and hosts some of the biggest websites such as Amazon.com and Netflix etc.
- Thy provide around 175 services services and some of them are IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, EBS etc. Based on the field you are working on, you can choose the service that is required to develop that application.
- AWS was initially launched on 2002 for maintaining thier amazon website and later they realized it is their one of the strength and launched it publicly with SQS in 2004. Later, in 2006 they launched with other services such as EC2, S3 etc. And in 2007, they expanded their services to other countries in Europe. Now it is one of the pioneer in the cloud market which runs so many businesses such as Drop Box, Netflix and even NASA also.
- In 2023, AWS has over $90 billion in annual revenue and they accounts 31% of market share in Q1 of 2024 ( where microsoft is in second place with 21%) and they have over 1 million active users over the world now.
